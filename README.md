# Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves predicting the price of Airbnb listings based on various features such as location, room type, and amenities using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Airbnb listing data, which contains features like accommodation type, number of bedrooms, review scores, etc.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build predictive models that estimate the price of Airbnb listings based on available features. We use regression models to create and evaluate the accuracy of the price prediction.

## Steps Involved
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
2. Feature engineering and preparation for model training.
3. Building and evaluating predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
4. Visualizing correlations between features and target variable.

## Outcome
- Evaluated multiple models and achieved an R-squared score for both Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.
- Insights into feature importance and relationships with the price.
- Visualization of correlations between features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Requirements
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
